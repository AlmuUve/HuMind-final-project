<h1>ðŸ§  HuMind</h1>

We are @AlmuUve, @Jose and @Rafaela; and...

<h2>We connect companies with psycologists</h2>

We believe in the **importance of putting mental health and well-being first**.

We want to **promote training from within companies** that leads to **improvement in the well-being of their employees** that is reflected both personally and at work.

<h2>How will we get it?</h2>

<ul>

<li>Offering a service that adds value to companies without investing more than the training-oriented budget.</li>

<li>Helping psychologists increase their business, growing their client base.</li>

<li>Supporting the management of emotions and stress that can be generated in the highly competitive work environments in which we operate today.</li>

<li>Facilitate in the same platform that companies can connect with psychologists and decide on the one that best suits their needs.</li>

<li>Offer piscologists a platform where they can offer their services in the business environment. They can generate content to have more visibility, provide their services on the platform itself, offer workshops, etc.</li>

</ul>

<h2>We care about UX</h2>
